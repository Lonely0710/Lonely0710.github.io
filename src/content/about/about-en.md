Hi, I’m Lonely!

> The name `Lonely` sounds quite similar to my real name. 
> 
> It started as a nickname given by friends, and over time it naturally became the name I’ve continued to use in online and technical communities.

I am currently a ***B.S.*** student at [BJTU](https://cs.bjtu.edu.cn/)
and an incoming ***M.S.*** student at the [HIAS](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/znkxyjs/index.htm).

My research interests focus on **LLM-based Agents**, particularly their reasoning strategies, memory and planning mechanisms, and system-level implementations for real-world scenarios.

This blog is more like a **personal space** for me — a place to leave traces of my thinking and work, and to look back on in the future:
- Recording daily **thoughts and reflections**
- Organizing my **hands-on experience in computer-related practice**
- Occasionally sharing **personal playlists and music notes**

---

Most of my code is hosted on GitHub:
- [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Lonely0710)
- **Undergraduate Labs & Course Projects**
::github{repo="Lonely0710/CS-Undergrad-Labs"}
